# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This repository hosts a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the technical assessment for the Mondasi Web Development Internship.

## Project Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (X or O) vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Interactive 3x3 grid
- Responsive design
- Win detection and game reset

- Navigate to the project directory:

~~~

- Open **index.html** in your preferred web browser.

- Players take turns clicking on the empty cells in the grid to place their marks (X or O).
